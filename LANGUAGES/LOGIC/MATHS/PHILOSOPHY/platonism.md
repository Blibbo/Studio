**Platonism** is a view on the [[philosophy of mathematics]] that sees mathematical objects as belonging to a world beyond the physical one _and also_ beyond our imagination.

It aged like fine wine because [[GÃ¶del's incompleteness theorems]] demonstrated there could be truths unreachable by our logic, but true indeed.

In contrast, [[Logicism]]'s view that maths is objective decayed because our implicit assumptions for doing maths are unprovable.
