## Formally

A space in the [[cartesian plane]] where all points ${ P }$ reside:

${ \forall P : \text{distance}(P,P_{1}) + \text{distance}(P,P_{2}) = \text{distance}(P_{1},P_{2}) }$

$\sqrt{ (x-x_{1})^2+(y-y_{1})^2 }+\sqrt{ (x-x_{2})^2+(y-y_{2})^2 }=\text{length}$

This equation describes every point in a given segment with:
- ${ P_{1}(x_{1},y_{1}) }$ as the first extreme
- ${ P_{2}(x_{2},y_{2}) }$ as the second extreme
- ${ \text{length} }$ as the length (distance between ${ P_{1} }$ and ${ P_{2} }$)
