**Classical logic** is the basic [[logic]] that is used in many fields, such as [[science]], [[philosophy]] and [[Mathematics|maths]].

[[propositional logic]] and [[FOL|predicate logic]] are formalizations of this logic.

In classical logic, there are only two truth values: "true" (often denoted as "T" or "1") and "false" (often denoted as "F" or "0").

1. **Bivalence Principle**: Every proposition is either true or false, with no middle ground. This is also known as the law of excluded middle.
    
2. **Law of Non-Contradiction**: A proposition cannot be both true and false at the same time. If a proposition P is true, then its negation ¬P is false, and vice versa.
    
3. **Law of Identity**: Any proposition is identical to itself. For any proposition P, P is P.
    
4. **Truth Functional Operators**: Classical logic uses truth-functional operators such as AND (conjunction), OR (disjunction), NOT (negation), IF-THEN (implication), and IF AND ONLY IF (biconditional). The truth value of complex propositions is determined by the truth values of their constituent propositions and the logical operators used.
    
5. **Quantifiers**: Classical logic often includes quantifiers like "for all" (∀) and "there exists" (∃), which are used to express statements about sets and collections of objects.
    
6. **Deductive Systems**: Classical logic provides systems of rules for deriving conclusions from premises, such as modus ponens (if P→Q and P are true, then Q is true) and modus tollens (if P→Q and ¬Q are true, then ¬P is true).
