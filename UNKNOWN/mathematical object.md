A **mathematical object** is an abstract object which's nature is unknown to us.
Our current [[language (theoretical computer science)|formal]] definition is that it's a [[set]].

We built [[mathematics|maths]] around this thought and [[axiom|axiomatized]] a [[set theory]] ([[ZFC]]) that is able to define every mathematical object we've used so far as a set of some kind.

## Philosophy

There are different philosophies on what a mathematical object truly is:
- [[platonism]]: mathematical objects belong to a perfect world of ideas that's neither physical nor in our mind;
- [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]: it's all in our head;
- [[formalism]]: they're just symbols we write on paper.
