A **solution stack** is the set of components that compose a [[platform]].
So it's the set of things required in order for software to run.

These components are "stacked" on top of each other.
**Example:** [[Electron]]'s tech stack is [[Chromium]], [[Node.js]] ==& their respective tech stacks==, which brings us all the way down to hardware.
