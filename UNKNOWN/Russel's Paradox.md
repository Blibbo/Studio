**Russel's Paradox** is a paradox thought of by [[Bertrand Russel|Bertrand Russel]] involving [[set theory]].

It goes something like: "Does the [[set]] of all those sets that do not contain themselves contain itself?"

## Russel's solution

Russel found this paradox in [[Begriffsschrift]], and attempted to fix it in his own book [[Principia Mathematica]]

>[[Principia Mathematica|PM]] sought to avoid this problem by ruling out the unrestricted creation of arbitrary sets. This was achieved by replacing the notion of a general set with notion of a hierarchy of sets of different '[[Type theory|types]]', a set of a certain type only allowed to contain sets of strictly lower types. Contemporary mathematics, however, avoids paradoxes such as Russell's in less unwieldy ways, such as the system of [[ZF|Zermeloâ€“Fraenkel set theory]].
