# free variables & bound variables

Variables can be either **free** or **bound**.

A **free variable** is a symbol, a placeholder to be replaced.
Old textbooks call them _real variables_.

A **bound variable** is a free variable (a symbol) that has been instantiated (replaced). We say it's _bound_ to a **specific value**.
Old textbooks call them _apparent variables_
