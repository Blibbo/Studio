When something is **atomic**, it means it's a single _irreducible_, _indivisible_ unit within a larger system.

It sometimes literally means "relating to the [[atom]]" because ***duh***, but I'm finding "atomic" to be more common in the sense I described above; exception made for the phrase "atomic bomb" and other [[chemistry]] and [[nuclear physics]] stuff.
