**Non-measurable sets** are something that's "necessary" (arguable) for definitions but lead to funky paradoxes, most famously the [[Banachâ€“Tarski paradox]].

They get created through the [[axiom of choice]], and if you want to refute them at all costs you have the option to accept [[ZF]] and not its extended [[ZFC]] counterpart.
