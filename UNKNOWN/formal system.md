A **formal system** is your framework to do [[logic#Formal logic|formal logic]].
Each formal system is the definition of a specific [[proof theory]].

Formal systems are foundational to [[mathematical logic]].

Formal systems are also employed in [[CS]], linguistics and even philosophy, but I'm not sure what they do with them.
I'd like to figure out whether this definition for formal systems is also somehow valid for programming languages.

## Language

It's a language (possibly a [[language (theoretical computer science)]]) 

## Deductive system

The **deductive system** is the set of [[axiom|axioms]] and inference rules to manipulate [[wff|formulas]] within the language.

## Characteristics

These rules you choose get usually chosen in a specific fashion; that is, to strive for these three characteristics:
- [[consistency]]
