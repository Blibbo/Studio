## Elegant

- A proof that uses a minimum of additional assumptions or previous results.
- A proof that is unusually succinct.
- A proof that derives a result in a surprising way (e.g., from an apparently unrelated [[theorem]] or a collection of theorems).
- A proof that is based on new and original insights.
- A method of proof that can be easily generalized to solve a family of similar problems.

## Ugly

Results that are logically correct but involve laborious calculations, over-elaborate methods, highly conventional approaches or a large number of powerful axioms or previous results are usually not considered to be elegant, and may be even referred to as _ugly_ or _clumsy_
