The **Banach-Tarski paradox** is a paradox of [[ZFC]] where starting from an original sphere, you're basically able to construct two spheres equal in volume to the original by rotating a finite number of non-overlapping pieces.

It only takes a minimum of five pieces. The proof is very convoluted and mind boggling.

We aren't sure whether this breaks maths or not. Instead it's being theorized to be physically possible with quantum particles (it's a stretch).

The paradox was thought of by [[Stefan Banach]] and [[Alfred Tarski]]

## Where did we go wrong

It's the "C" part in [[ZFC]]: the [[AoC|axiom of choice]]. That's what fucks everything up so badly.

The catch in this paradox is that these five pieces, which are totally finite in mass and volume, are cut out of the original sphere in an infinitely complex fashion.
These pieces are a thing called "unmeasurable sets"

>How the Axiom of Choice can lead to this paradox regarding our notions of volume is that the axiom allows for the construction of non-measurable sets. This decomposition and reconstruction cannot be done in the physical world, because if you take and apple and cut it up into pieces with a knife, each of these pieces is “measurable.” That is, they have boundaries and a sense of volume, whereas the sets constructed using the Axiom of Choice do not obey these properties
