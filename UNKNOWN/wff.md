The phrase **well-formed formula** refers to "a sequence of symbols written correctly for your context".
It means "syntactically correct thing" within your [[language (maths)]].

## Ambiguity

A wff is typically _either_ a **formula** (with the definition found [[#formula|below]]), _or_ an **expression**.

The "formula" part of the phrase "well-formed _formula_" can be misleading because what we actually want to convey is just the "well-formed" part.

Additionally, sometimes a wff is simply called "formula", and it could actually be an expression.
