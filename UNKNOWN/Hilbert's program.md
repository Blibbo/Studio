**Hillbert's program** is a plan to "solve mathematics" formulated by [[David Hilbert]] in the early 1920s.
It consists in finding axioms from which you can derive any theorem imaginable, without creating paradoxes.

Long story short, it's impossible. See [[GÃ¶del's incompleteness theorems]].

Still though, even though there technically are infinite mathematical truths that are unreachable by our logic, we can still "complete" this program for all commonly used maths.
