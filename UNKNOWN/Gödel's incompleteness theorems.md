## First incompleteness theorem

>No [[consistency|consistent]] [[formal system|system]] of axioms whose theorems can be listed by an effective procedure (i.e., an algorithm) is capable of proving all truths about the arithmetic of [[natural numbers]]. For any such consistent formal system, there will always be statements about natural numbers that are true, but that are unprovable within the system.

## Second incompleteness theorem

>No sufficiently sophisticated [[formal system]] can prove its own [[consistency]].
