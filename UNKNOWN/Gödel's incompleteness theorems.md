**GÃ¶del's incompleteness theorems** are two, and they state the following:
1. No [consistent system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency "Consistency") of [axioms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom "Axiom") whose theorems can be listed by an [effective procedure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_procedure "Effective procedure") (i.e., an [algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm "Algorithm")) is capable of proving all truths about the arithmetic of [natural numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_number "Natural number"). For any such consistent formal system, there will always be statements about natural numbers that are true, but that are unprovable within the system.
2. The system cannot demonstrate its own consistency.
