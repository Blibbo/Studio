>Even God cannot escape circular logic, because He is the highest authority. Who would He appeal to if not Himself. What is right is what He thinks is right. That’s circular

[[propositional logic]] is full of these "logical fallacies", but it appears that it's a fundamental limitation rather than a mistake.

>At some level logic must make an appeal to something higher than itself. Traditionally, lower reason (ratio inferior; dianoia; logismos) is validated by direct grasp of conscience or higher reason (ratio superior; noesis; theoria).

For example, we do not prove that a = a; we see it by an immediate grasp of Intellect, or what Plato called the eye of the soul. Just as we accept visual perceptions as self-evidently true, so too with the ‘vision’ of the Intellect.
>
In theory we have templates or patterns (or Platonic Forms) present in our nature prior to reasoning. We are ‘hard wired’ to know that a = a, prior to any logical argument.

## Theory of everything

**Would the theory of everything be circular reasoning?**
https://www.quora.com/Would-the-theory-of-everything-be-circular-reasoning

>The correct answer to this question is yes, necessarily so, and the appropriate way to qualify such a statement is thus: although the theory of everything would necessarily be circular, it would only need to be circular in the sense that all truth is.
>
That is to say that, ==insofar as you propose that anything is true, you utilise a system of logical rules to do so, and with that system of rules, you can validate propositions in the language; one thing you cannot do, however, is validate the rules themselves. This is a fundamental shortcoming of logical reasoning which has been pondered for centuries, and synthesised formally by Godel in his famous incompleteness theorems; there is no complete system of logic which is capable of formally proving itself.==
>
In light of this, we have to admit that when we utilise logic, we are only capable of doing so, in the performative sense, by making the axiomatic assumptions of logic in practice. Unless one assumes the principles of logic, no reasoning can be conducted, yet we often fail to recognise the assumptions that nonetheless underly even the most skeptical of approaches; axiomatic assumptions are indispensable in the end, because we cannot know what is true, so we are forced to assume at least one thing in order to attempt to progress in the world.
>
In lieu of assumptions, we fail to interpret, understand or act, and we quickly expire. Insofar, then, as we are always making assumptions, any conclusion that we come to about the validity of those assumptions is going to be a product of a fundamentally circular process, because the apprehension of validity cannot even be attempted unless we take as valid the presuppositions of the process we use to evaluate.
>
Thus, to very carefully speak very little about ‘theories of everything’, I will conclude with two key points:
>
If someone were to produce a theory of everything which was precisely and comprehensively consistent with the actual state of affairs, then despite the consistency with truth, one would still be forced to propose the notion subjectively, which entails the circularity already discussed. Thus, yes, the Theory of Everything must necessarily exhibit circularity; nonetheless, this circularity is effectively irrelevant when contextualised appropriately as the circularity common to any and all subjective propositions about Truth. As this circularity is a fundamentally unavoidable aspect of proposing anything to be true, it’s not a criterion which is relevant for the falsification of a theory about first principles.

## Arithmetic

>There are an arbitrary number of arithmetic operations that can all be reduced to just one: the Successor function [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Successor_function]
The four well known operations are all binary functions that can be represented with an infix operator [ https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Infix_operator&redirect=no]
All of these and numbers themselves can be defined in terms of the Peano Axioms [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peano_axioms]
which have two primitive objects: \[gatekept\]
