An **axiom** is a [[proposition]] that we consider to be always true, even though it's not self-evident.

This means, it's **not** an [[analytic proposition]]. However, given that every proposition is either analytic or synthetic, it must be a [[synthetic proposition]].

Maths is founded on these, making all of maths synthetic, making [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] right and [[Gottlob Frege|Gottlob]] wrong.
