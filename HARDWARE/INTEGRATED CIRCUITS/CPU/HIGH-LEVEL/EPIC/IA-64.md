**Itanium** is a [[microprocessor architecture]].

128 general-purpose [[register|registers]], another 128 floating point registers.

 It has something called RSE (Register Stack Engine), which as far as I understand is just registers being even faster.
 It has a mechanism called predication, where each instructions get executed based on the value of a register called predicate, IDFK.
 It has another mechanism called "speculative execution" where it tries to GUESS what it will have to execute in advance and executes it. If it fails, there's error correction

## Implements

[[EPIC]], but it used to be [[VLIW]]

## [[ISA|Instruction set architecture]]

The instruction set is commonly called **IA-64**.

## History

[[Intel]] developed Itanium with the goal of killing [[CISC]] and [[RISC]] altogether in favor of [[EPIC]], and failed miserably.
In 2021, they shipped their last Itanium [[microprocessor]].
