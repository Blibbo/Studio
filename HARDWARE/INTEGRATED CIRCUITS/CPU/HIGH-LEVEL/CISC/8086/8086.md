**8086** is both a [[microprocessor]] and a [[microprocessor architecture]].

It has a 16-bit data bus and a 20-bit address bus (1MB).

## Implements

[[CISC]], but it breaks the instructions down into [[RISC]] instructions.
- [[#^cisc-to-risc]]

## [[ISA]]

This is the blueprint for modern CISC processors (every PC, basically): they all use expanded versions of this ISA.
