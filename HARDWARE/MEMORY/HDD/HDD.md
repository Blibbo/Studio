### About HDDs

- there's like this disk that spins really fast and has 0s and 1s in it :)
- there's a weird air layer that gets created bc it spins fast
- the thingy that reads stuff magnetically floats on the air layer like a boat
- if it messes up it scratches the disk (it only messes up if the disk is damaged and is like oval or something)
- needs [[Defragmentation|defrag]]
