There is no general consensus among mathematicians about a common definition for their academic discipline.

Most mathematical activities revolve around trying to prove, using pure reason, [[property|properties]] of abstract [[mathematical object|objects]].
These objects are either abstractions from nature, or they're made the fuck up.

The made-up objects have made-up properties, called [[axiom|axioms]].
