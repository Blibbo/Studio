There is no general consensus among mathematicians about a common definition for their academic discipline.

Most mathematical activities revolve around trying to prove, using pure reason, [[property|properties]] of abstract [[mathematical object|objects]].
These objects are either abstractions from nature, or they're made the fuck up.

The made-up objects have made-up properties, called [[axiom|axioms]].

## Pure Mathematics

Known as _theoretical mathematics_ or _mathematics proper_.
Studies concepts, structures and relationships for their intrinsic beauty and for intellectual satisfaction.

---

## Applied Mathematics

Mathematicians, engineers and stuff make boring [[model theory|models]] that represent actual problems that need solutions.

I'm exaggerating it. It's cool, it really explains actual things that happen.
