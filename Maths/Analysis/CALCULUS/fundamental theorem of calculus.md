The **fundamental theorem of calculus** is actually made up of two theorems.
Both are about relating [[differential calculus|differentiation]] to [[integral calculus|integration]].

# First Fundamental Theorem of Calculus

For a [[continuous function]] ${ f }$, an [[antiderivative]] or indefinite integral ${ F }$ can be obtained as the integral of ${ f }$ over an interval with a variable upper bound.

# Second Fundamental Theorem of Calculus

The integral of a function ${ f }$ over a fixed interval is equal to the change of any antiderivative ${ F }$ between the ends of the interval.
