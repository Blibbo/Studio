**Calculus** is a branch of [[mathematics|maths]] that is introductory to [[analysis]].

Its purpose is dealing with [[differential calculus|differentiation]] and [[integral calculus|integration]].
To do that, it defines concepts such as [[limit|limits]], [[continuous function|continuous functions]] and [[derivative|derivatives]].

This field requires knowledge of [[Algebra]] and [[trigonometry]].

## History

[[Isaac Newton]] and [[Leibniz]] both independently invented calculus.
Stuff similar to calculus can be seen everywhere in history long before them, but they're the first ones to address this set of practices and make them known.

There's a controversy on who of the two started investigating these methods first.
Newton was a professor at Cambridge University and was the one to make everything public first (1665-1666)
Leibniz made his first publication about it in 1676.

Nowadays, it is agreed upon that they both independently invented calculus.

Newton made most of the formulas known.
Leibniz made the symbols we currently use.

The first books about it were published by [[Euler]] and were called "Differential Calculus" and "Integral Calculus" (1768)
