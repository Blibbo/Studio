the **[[Pythagoras|Pythagorean]] theorem** explains the relationship between the three sides of a [[Right triangle|right angled triangle]].

What it says is if a triangle is a right-angled triangle, then the square of the hypothenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides

## Formally

${ a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2} }$
_Pythagoras equation_

${ a = \text{leg of right triangle} }$
${ b = \text{leg of right triangle} }$
${ c = \text{hypothenuse} }$

Solve for ${ a }$
${ \sqrt{ c^{2}-b^{2} } }$

Solve for ${ b }$
${ \sqrt{ c^{2}-a^{2} } }$

Solve for ${ c }$
${ \sqrt{ a^{2}+b^{2} } }$
