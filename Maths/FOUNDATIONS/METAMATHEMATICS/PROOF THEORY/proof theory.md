**Proof theory** is the field of study analyzing provability.
It explores different [[formal system|formal systems]] for [[logic]] ([[logical system|logical systems]]).

We can also say a specific formal system generates "a proof theory".

Terms to investigate: [[consistency]], [[completeness]], [[decidability]].
