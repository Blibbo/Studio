## TL;DR

Modern [[mathematics|maths]] is based on [[set theory]].
The [[formal system]] for set theory is called [[ZF]].
We know set theory [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems|can't explain]] all mathematical truths.
We know set theory [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems|can't prove]] its own [[consistency]].
We use it because we _chose_ it. Math is subjective.
