>Informally put, the axiom of choice says that given any collection of sets, each containing at least one element, it is possible to construct a new set by choosing one element from each set, even if the collection is infinite

The **axiom of choice** is an [[axiom]] of [[set theory]] that's required in order for tons of maths to work at all.

It leads to what wikipedia describes as "seemingly paradoxical results" but they straight up look like harsh paradoxes, such as the [[Banachâ€“Tarski paradox]]
