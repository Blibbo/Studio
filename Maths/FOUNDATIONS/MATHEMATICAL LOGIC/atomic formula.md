An **[[atomic]] formula** is a single [[variable#free variables & bound variables|variable]] in the context of [[mathematical logic]] that holds a [[proposition#truth value|truth value]], and it's [[wff|well formed]] by definition.
It doesn't have any deeper structure to it. It has no subformulas. No [[logical connective|logical connectives]].

It's like a [[transistor]] but for maths.
It's sometimes called an _atom_.
