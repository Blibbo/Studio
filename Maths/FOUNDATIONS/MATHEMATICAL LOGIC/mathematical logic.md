Mathematical logic is a subset of [[logic#Formal logic|formal logic]] that focuses on [[mathematics]].

It seems to focus a lot on [[formal system|formal systems]].

Although they're different fields, [[metamathematics]] and [[metalogic]] are part of the _academical_ field of mathematical logic.

## History

When it was founded, in the search of the [[foundations of mathematics]] in the 19th century, it mostly overlapped with [[metamathematics]]; also founded around the same time.
Eventually, it began developing its own ideas with **new pure mathematics**:
- [[model theory]]
- [[proof theory]]
- [[recursion theory]]
- [[set theory]]
