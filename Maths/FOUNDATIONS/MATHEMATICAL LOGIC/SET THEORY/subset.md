It's a set within the set. It's pretty intuitive.
A set is technically a subset of itself though, which could be counterintuitive. Check the definition below to see why.

## Formally


${ \forall x (x \in A \implies x \in B) }$

Subset relation, or subset inclusion, is a binary relation between two sets.

If all the members of set ${ A }$ are also members of set ${ B }$, then ${ A }$ is a **subset** of ${ B }$,
denoted ${ A \subseteq B }$

### Proper Subsets

${ A }$ is called a **proper subset** of ${ B }$ if and only if ${ A }$ is a subset of ${ B }$, but ${ A }$ is not equal to ${ B }$.
${ A \subset B }$

## Inferential

${ A \subseteq B \Longleftrightarrow A \cap B = A }$

${ A \subseteq B \Longleftrightarrow A \cup B = B }$

${ A }$ is finite.
${ A \subseteq B \Longleftrightarrow |A \cap B | = |A|}$
