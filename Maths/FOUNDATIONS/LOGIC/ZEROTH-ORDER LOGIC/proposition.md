A **proposition** is a statement that is **true** or **false**.

## [[formal language|Formally]]

A proposition can be either represented by a single [[#Propositional variables|variable]], or by an expression including [[logical connective|logical connectives]] and multiple variables, as long as it's [[propositional logic#WFF|well formed]].

### Propositional variables

**Propositional variables** or **proposition letters** are a [[notation]] to indicate [[variable|variables]] representing propositions.
The symbol is a bolded capital letter, for example:
$\mathbf{A}$

~~Mind blowing, amiright~~

### Truth value

Any proposition in propositional logic holds a **truth value**.

${ v(\mathbf{P}) }$ evaluates the proposition ${ \mathbf{P} }$: it returns its truth value.

**Example:**
${ v(\mathbf{A}) = \text{true} }$
