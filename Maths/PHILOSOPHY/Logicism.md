**Logicism** is a view first held by [[Bertrand Russel]] and [[Gottlob Frege]] to oppose [[Immanuel Kant]]'s view that [[mathematics]] is "inside of the human mind".
Instead, logicism claims maths to be objective and to be a branch of [[logic]].

Gottlob's and Russel's combined work had the goal of proving arithmetic to be a consequence of [[FOL|first-order predicate logic]]
