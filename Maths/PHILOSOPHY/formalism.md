**Formalism** is a theory on the [[philosophy of mathematics]].
It states that [[mathematics|maths]] is just about symbols (strings of characters) and rules about how to manipulate them.
It's the complete rejection of [[platonism]]. They don't want to deal with whether numbers exist at all.

>Term formalism is the view that mathematical expressions refer to symbols, not numbers

>When it comes to definition, I take a purely formal position, in that I call certain tangible signs numbers, so that the existence of these numbers is not in question.
