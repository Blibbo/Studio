Branch of mathematics that studies sets.
Sets are collections of objects. Objects of any kind.

This is the foundation of mathematics as a whole.

## Membership relation

${ o \in A }$
object ${ o }$ is in set ${ A }$.

Sets also count as objects. Hence, the membership relation can relate sets as well.

**Notation** ${ \{  \} \leftarrow }$ within those brackets, you can list a set's elements to refer to the set.
