**Physics** is a branch of science that concerns itself with understanding the fundamental principles that govern the universe.
Its goal is describing a phenomenon in quantitative terms.

A definition is introduced _if_ it's strictly necessary to the quantitative description of a phenomenon.

When we say quantitative, we mean measurable.
A physical quantity is denoted by an unit of measure and accompanied by an error.

The main pursuit of physics is finding the **kinematic law**: a law that predicts the position of an object at a given point in time.
We use **models** to study individual phenomenons and hope to ultimately connect different models into more accurate ones.

## Overlap with [[chemistry]]

Topics covered by physics range from things such as [[nuclear physics|nuclear fission]] to the dynamics of galaxies.
It studies energy and matter at their most basic levels.

It shares with chemistry topics such as atomic and molecular structure, but physics is a really broad field, while chemistry is more specialized on substances and reactions
