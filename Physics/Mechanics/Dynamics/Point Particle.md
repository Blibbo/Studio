It's a body without dimension.

It's a [[model|simplification]] of a physical object that consists in considering the object's [[length|dimension in space]] to be just a point.

---

We apply this model when the object's size is orders of magnitude smaller than its motion within the studied timeframe.
**Examples:**
- earth's motion in a year
- me moving 10km with my car. You can calculate the motion fairly accurately without accounting for each one of the ${ 10^{27} }$ atoms that compose me
