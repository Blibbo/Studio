**Analysis** is a branch of [[Mathematics|maths]] that studies quantities and their change.
Its foundation is [[calculus]].

It's the antithesis to [[discrete mathematics]]. Nobody really calls it "continuous mathematics", but that's what it is.

Terms to investigate: [[complex analysis]], [[real analysis]], [[functional analysis]], [[measure theory]], [[sequence|sequences]], [[serie|series]], [[metric space|metric spaces]], [[topology|topological properties]]
