There is no general consensus among mathematicians about a common definition for their academic discipline.

Most mathematical activities revolve around trying to prove, using pure reason, [[property|properties]] of abstract [[mathematical object|objects]].
These objects are either abstractions from nature, or they're made the fuck up.

The made-up objects have made-up properties, called [[axiom|axioms]].

## Pure Mathematics

Known as _theoretical mathematics_, _mathematics proper_ or _abstract mathematics_
Studies abstract concepts, structures and relationships for their intrinsic beauty and for intellectual satisfaction.

## Applied Mathematics

Mathematicians, engineers and stuff make boring [[model theory|models]] that represent actual problems that need solutions.
^^^ I wrote that as a joke but as I study, this seems to be a solid take, look at this: [[G. H. Hardy]]

## Branches

There are a shit ton of branches of maths and it's dumb to list any as being "major branches".
Different sources assign different subdisciplines as being "main ones".

- [[number theory]]
- [[Algebra]]
- [[geometry]]
- [[Mathematical Analysis|Analysis]]
