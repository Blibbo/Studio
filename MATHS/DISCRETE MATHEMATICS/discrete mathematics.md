**Discrete mathematics** is a field of [[Mathematics|maths]] that focuses on discrete values rather than continuous changes.

It's about stuff you can count. You can't count [[real number|real numbers]] in order, for example. So real numbers aren't a prominent topic in discrete mathematics.

The antithesis is [[mathematical analysis]] that only covers real and complex numbers.
