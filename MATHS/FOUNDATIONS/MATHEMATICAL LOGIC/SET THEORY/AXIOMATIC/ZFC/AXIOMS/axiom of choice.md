The **axiom of choice** is an [[axiom]] of [[set theory]] that's required in order for tons of maths to work at all.

>Informally put, the axiom of choice says that given any collection of sets, each containing at least one element, it is possible to construct a new set by choosing one element from each set, even if the collection is infinite

This axiom leads to what wikipedia describes as "_seemingly_ paradoxical results" but they straight up look like brutal paradoxes, such as the [[Banach–Tarski paradox]]

- [[Banach–Tarski paradox#^cognitive-coitus]] ^cognitive-coitus

## Why it bugs people

>the controversy is that there is no specified rule for which element is chosen from each set. In this way, the choice function is uniquely and intriguingly human
- [[#^cognitive-coitus]]


The axiom itself isn't evil. It's just one technicality that bugs people: choosing from an _infinite_ collection of sets.
As far as I understand, finite collections are fine.
However, infinite collections are the whole point. It's just not terribly powerful otherwise.

### Order???

>the Axiom of Choice becomes less intuitive when you’re dealing with sets of infinite elements, like the segment (0,1) of the real numbers, because there is not a natural way to decide which element of the set your choice function chooses (because the real numbers are not well-ordered by the traditional ordering). This is why, at first, the Axiom of Choice seemed weird and created controversy.

I don't get what it has to do with order though.
Other relevant quote:

>The Axiom of Choice can be deduced from its equivalence, the Well-Ordering Theorem which states that every set can rearranged in order

## The [[Banach–Tarski paradox]]

This axiom allows you to make [[non-measurable set|non-measurable sets]] which create this funky paradox.

>Today the Axiom of Choice is generally accepted by mathematicians and there are many paradoxes that arise independent of this axiom, so dismissing it outright because of some funky results is foolish nonsense

## History

The axiom of choice was formulated independently by [[Zermelo]] in 1904 as part of his investigation into set theory.
He opted not to insert it into his [[Zermelo set theory]]?? (chatgpt implied it. Don't know if it's true)
It would later be incorporated in the broader [[ZFC]].
