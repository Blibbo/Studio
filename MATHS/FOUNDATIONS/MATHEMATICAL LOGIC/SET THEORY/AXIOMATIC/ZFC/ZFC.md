**Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice** is the modern [[formal system]] for [[set theory]].
Its goal is providing a foundation to pretty much _all_ of modern [[Mathematics|maths]].
It's more or less considered satisfactory despite the occasional paradoxes.

As the name implies, ZFC is the [[ZF|ZF set theory]] with the additional added [[axiom of choice]].

## Any good?

It was developed before the insights provided by [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems]], so it might have been made with the (impossible) goal of completeness.
The thing about ZFC is that it proves pretty much every big theory and is pretty sound. ==We just didn't do any better yet==.
