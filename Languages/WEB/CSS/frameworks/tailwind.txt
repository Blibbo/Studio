	Tailwind migrated from the JIT engine:
		https://tailwindcss.com/docs/upgrade-guide#configure-content-sources
	
	CHECK THE VERSION WITH
		npm view tailwindcss version
	OR
		npm info tailwindcss version
		
		
	[IGNORE EVERYTHING UP UNTIL THIS POINT]
	
	Make it work on Laravel: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73142864/npm-run-watch-not-working-and-returning-errors-saying-missing-watch
		go to package.json after having installed node and npm and ran their commands onto your project
		you'll see "vite build" and that translates to npm run build, well you CANNOT use that or tailwind
		gets all fucked up for some reason. ADD THIS LINE INSTEAD (right under '"build": "vite build",'):
		"watch": "vite build --watch"
		
		then to run the whole thing you have to use:
			npm run watch
		and then you can even close that prompt.

BOX MODEL
	bg-gray-100			colors the background.
	border				makes a solid border.
	border-3			makes a solid border which is 3 px thick.
	border-l			makes a solid border on the left
	border-l-4			makes a solid border-left and 4 px thick.
	border-gray-200		colors the border.

	mt-10				margin-top of 10 pixels.
	-mt-10				margin-top of -10 pixels.
	p-6					padding of 6 pixels.
	space-y-6			element + element{margin-top: 6px} I think. But on the direct children.
	divide-y			element + element will have a border in between
	divide-gray-600		set the divide's color
	rounded-xl			rounded box
	rounded-full		tries to make a circle (can't if it's a rectangle)
	max-w-sm			sets the maximum width to "small"
	mx-auto				margin on the x axis set to auto.
	h-50				set the height to 50 px
	w-50				set the width to 50 px
	z-10 				(to 50, 0 or auto are accepted too) z-index: 10
	max-h-48			max height
	overflow-auto		scroll if there's more content and a max height
	hidden				display:none
	
FLEX
	flex				display:flex to the element.
	flex-shrink-0		prevents the flexbox from shrinking the element.
	items-				align along the secondary axis. Works on grid too
		center			center of the secondary axis
		end				aligns items at the end of the secondary axis (on the bottom of the row normally)
	justify-
		end				end of primary axis (to the right if normal flex)
	justify-between		gets flex children as far away from each other as possible
	flex-col			makes the flexbox vertical and justify-end would go to the bottom
	gap-8				gap on the x axis
	min-w-0				if the flex child overflows the parent, use this
	
	FLEX CHILDREN
		flex-1				children of a flexbox can use it. It makes the element as big as it can get(???)


GRID

	lg:grid-cols-12		the grid has 12 columns
	
	gap-x-10			makes the columns have a 10px gap between them (on the x axis)
	space-x-10			a replacement for gap for browser compatibility. It fucks with the margins
						of the elements inside. I recommend gap
	auto-rows-min		makes it so the rows' height fits the content.
	
	place-items-center	guess.
