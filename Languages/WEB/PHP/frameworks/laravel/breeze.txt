Laravel breeze is a minimal authentication starter kit
https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/starter-kits

go on your app folder and run this command
composer require laravel/breeze --dev

php artisan breeze:install
"git status" is a command which explains what the previous command did
you can't run it like that though, just google what you gotta download to use it
	
node -v
npm -v
if both work it means you have both node and npm and you're set to go

now run:
	npm install && npm run dev 
		handles front end dependancies. package.json as opposed to the php dependancies handled
		by composer.json
	
	npm run dev
		is enough for all the other times you gotta start the server

in your project's database folder make a databaseName.sqlite file (sqlite is file based)
.env
	DB_DATABASE: absolute path of your db. Cd in there and use "cd" to see the current path
	
then migrate your tables and you're good to go. There will be a bunch of new views and
controllers in your projects, change the views to match the website's style
