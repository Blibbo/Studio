This is a piece of [[Software]] that runs on [[browser|browsers]].
The way you interact with this software is through a [[JavaScript]] [[API]].

It allows you to render 2D and 3D graphics.
There aren't really other ways to interact with the [[GPU]] within the context of a web browser, so it's a big deal.

It is based on [[OpenGL]] ES.

This API mostly interacts with a specific [[HTML]] tag called [[HTML#^canvas|canvas]], inside of which you can draw using your GPU.
