  - Canvas API

**Canvas** is a [[HTML#Tags|tag]] introduced in HTML5.
It can be manipulated through a [[JavaScript]] [[API]].

The API allows you to draw stuff inside this tag that you normally wouldn't be able to make with just plain HTML.
It's not very performant. [[WebGL]] came out to one-up it.
