	NPM vs NPX
		https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/npm-vs-npx-whats-the-difference/
		npm doesn't have anything by itself.
		LOCAL INSTALLS
			npm will install packages into /node_modules/.bin
		GLOBAL INSTALLS
			npm will install stuff onto %appdata%/npm
		NPX
			npx is bundled with npm nowadays. It installs stuff. it quik.
			If it's not installed somehow just run
				npm install -g npx
			npx can run scripts without installing them in your machine.
			Ex:
				npx https://gist.github.com/AnUser/aScript29k4k25k46k3n6j2
			executes a script it finds online. Careful with it
				or npx cowsay wow (it say wow :o)
