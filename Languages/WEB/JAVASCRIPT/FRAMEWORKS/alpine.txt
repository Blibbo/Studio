ALPINE COMPONENT
	to make an alpine component you just have to add the x-data attribute
	<div x-data="{varName: value}"> <!--the thing in the {} is a js object,
		it's the "single source of truth for this component"-->

ATTRIBUTES
	<div x-show="varName" <!--shows IF the expression passed is true. Uses css' display:none
		so you should probably set it by default for drop down menus if you don't want it to
		appear for a moment before alpine loads on the page-->
		
		x-init="js code" <!--executes code immediately-->
		
		x-text="state" <!--changes the text in the div-->
	>

EVENTS
	<button @click="alert('helo')" > <!--pretty much the onclick event-->
		you can change variables made through alpine components here too
		
	@click.away="js code" <!--when you click somewhere else-->
	
	@click.prevent="" <!--prevents the default action. Can be used on anchor tags-->
