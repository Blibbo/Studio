### About AngularJS

- Apparently giga-based
- has achieved godlike status and is glorified online
- written in [[JavaScript]]
- AngularJS means "Angular version 1.x"
- from version 2 and forward it's just called [[Angular]] and it's written in another language entirely ~~(as if. It's just a language that compiles to javascript lol)~~
