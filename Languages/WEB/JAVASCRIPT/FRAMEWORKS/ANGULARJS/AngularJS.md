**AngularJS** is a beloved and apparently giga-based [[JavaScript]] framework developed by [[Google]].
It's one of the first frameworks to develop [[SPA|single page applications]].

## Trivia

AngularJS was released in 2010.

When people say AngularJS, they mean "Angular version 1.x"
From version 2 and forward it's just called [[Angular]] and it's written in [[TypeScript]]

AngularJS has achieved godlike status and is glorified online.
