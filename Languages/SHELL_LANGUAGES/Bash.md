### About Bash

- stands for "**Bourne Again Shell**"
- builds on the [[SH|Bourne Shell]], but user friendl*ier*
- shell for a bunch of [[Unix]] like systems, most notably [[Linux]] and [[macOS]] (ew)
- backwards compatible: most SH scripts can be run by Bash
- on Unix-like systems that support it bash is the default shell and it runs when you execute `{bash}sh`
	- ~~execute `{bash}sh` on what? another shell? lol~~

### Syntax

- `{bash}./programInThisFolder`
	- execute a program located in the current folder
	- `{bash}"./program in this folder"`
		- if it has spaces it needs the quotation marks
- `{bash}command & othercommand`
	- execute concurrently
- `{bash}command && othercommand`
	- execute `command` and after you're done `othercommand`
	- both must finish
- `command | othercommand`
	- give `othercommand` the output of `command` as an input
