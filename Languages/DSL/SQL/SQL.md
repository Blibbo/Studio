It's a [[DSL]] that allows you to interact with [[Databases]].
It's divided into four sub-languages: [[#DDL]], [[#DML]], [[#DQL]], [[#DCL]].
We call this a **declarative language** because we don't use it to describe algorithms to do what we want to do: we just declare _that_ we want to do it.

## DDL

Stands for **Data Definition Language**. Its purpose is working with definitions.

## DML

Stands for **Data Manipulation Language**. It works with actual data.

## DQL

Stands for **Data Query Language**. Allows you to query your data without interacting with it. It's just for reading it.

## DCL

Stands for **Data Control Language**. Manages which users have access to which data.
