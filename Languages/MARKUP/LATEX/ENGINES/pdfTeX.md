[[TeX]] engine. Expanded version of the original TeX.
Normally, to produce pdfs in TeX you'd need an additional conversion from [[DVI]] to [[PDF]].
This engine is designed to remove that step and produce pdfs directly.

It has additional features, such as microtypography, font expansion and inclusion of PDF images.
