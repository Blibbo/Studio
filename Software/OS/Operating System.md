It's an interface between you and your hardware.

It's composed of a [[#kernel]] and an [[#userland]].

## Kernel

Handles the hardware, has all the drivers and shit

## Userland

The userland is what the operating system has to offer to the user. It can include graphical interfaces, CLI commands and any other utility they're willing to give you.
