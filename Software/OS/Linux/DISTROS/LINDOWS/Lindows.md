**Lindows** is a ridiculous [[Windows]] knockoff.
It's a [[Linux|Linux kernel]] with a compatibility layer with Windows executables (an [[emulator]]) called [[Wine]].
Then the userland is just Windows programs that run at suboptimal performance.

This OS used to cost around 30 dollars.

## Trivia

[[Microsoft]] sued and **lost** 20 million dollars somehow.
However, they still had to change the name to **Linspire** after the lawsuit.
