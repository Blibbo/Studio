### Trivia

- initiated by Richard Stallman 1983
- the point was to recreate [[Unix]] but have the whole world work at it. So he needed to both make the whole operating system (kernel + userland) AND to create a legal document that explained precisely what "open-source" means so that the source won't ever be closed again like [[Unix#Trivia|Bell Labs]] was doing
- he founded this organization of free software and stuff called [[FSF]]
- **FSF** tried developing its own kernel (called [[Hurd]]) to go along with GNU. **GNU/Hurd** didn't reach a stable release so they switched to this "**Linus Torvalds**" guy's kernel called the [[Linux kernel]]. So what happened is uhh [[Linux]].
- he made the legal open source document thingy. It's called [[GPL]]. Linus agreed, now both the kernel and the userland are protected by it
- he won, pretty much
- Stallman advocates for the term "**GNU/Linux**" but people are just going to say Linux for short obviously. ~~what a fucking moron lol~~
