### About macOS

- sucks dick and balls
- based on [[Unix]] but they sorta did their own thing and changed it up a little bit

---

### Default Shell

- used to use [[Bash]] as its default shell (upon executing `sh`)
- has moved to [[Zsh|Z Shell]] in **macOS Catalina** (**macOS 10.15**) released in 2019
- old accounts still have Bash, new accounts made in 10.15+ have Zsh
- to figure out which one you have, execute `{bash}echo $SHELL`
	- it'll print either `/bin/bash` or `/bin/zsh`
