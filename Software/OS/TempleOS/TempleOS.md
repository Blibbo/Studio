**TempleOS** is an operating system developed entirely by one man, [[Terry Davis]].

It doesn't run on [[UEFI]] systems and probably not even on [[BIOS|legacy BIOS]].
The only way to run it for a lot of people is to do so under a [[VM|virtual machine]].

It really only uses one [[core]].

It doesn't have [[GPU]] acceleration and you're forced to use this system on a 800x600 resolution.
