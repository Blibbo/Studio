InnoDB is a storage engine that provides features such as transactions, foreign key constraints, and crash recovery.

## Tables

InnoDB tables store both data and indexes within the `.idb` file.
Tables may also have associated `.ibd` files for secondary indexes, in addition to the primary tablespace.
