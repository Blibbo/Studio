-Collisions. Hitboxes that you can't collide on but which are detected by shock cannon raycasts
-FastCast projectiles
-Make LightningSparks and LightningExplosion modules relative (create actual attachments)
-Graphic settings. MED will not have "Light", LOW won't even emit particles
Missiles:
	-Zap missiles
	-Homing missiles
	-Player controlled missiles
-Ship upgrades/switch special. Specials should have icons and they should be specific to
the ship.
	-Mobility upgrades: ships will move like actual ships, but they'll have motorized
	hinges on side propulsor thingies that will expand to the same angle as their current
	speed. Justifies how they slow down so quick and spin and go backwards and stuff. And it'll look cool as fuck
	-Vertical launch platforms for homing missiles and player controlled missiles
-REMAKE TURRET SYSTEM COMPLETELY OH MY GOD.
	Turret system ideas:
	UniversalConstraint
	 /HingeConstraint
	{BallSocketConstraint <--this replaces the current one with a nearly identical one
	 \BodyGyro
	RocketPropulsion
	Recursive rotating models
-Turret tracking system
	ideally, player mouse moves ball. Turrets follow ball physically. Just one property gets set
	in the turrets' physics constraint. And it happens on the server. Turrets will move on
	the server
-Turrets:
	Shield turret: shield is an AI ship with a lot of health with its team property set
	as the same as the player.
	Heal turret: no big deal, it deals average damage if it hits enemies.
	I COULD decide to make a ship do that instead though
	Super Turrets: they cost a shit ton lot, you can have ONE per ship.
	HOWEVER they're the same as the low cruiser's special. Which means, if you happen to
	upgrade the low cruiser's special turret, you'll get a comically powerful turret
	for a few seconds. Big brain.
-Ships:
	Healer ship: 2 turrets, the turrets become green whenever you lock onto an ally
-Lock on system:
	mouseBall goes into the PrimaryPart of the ship you're pointing.
-Gamemodes:
	KOTH. 2 Teams. If it was an FFA it would be dumb because the hill would be contested
	all the time
	Team Deathmatch, any number of teams
	Juggernaut.
		the juggernaut is 1.5x bigger and has that one cool ass color scheme
