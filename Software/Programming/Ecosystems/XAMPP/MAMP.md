It's a package that sets you up with an [[Apache]] [[HTTP]] web server, a [[PHP]] engine and a [[MySQL]] server for the php to interface with.

When you run this program, both the apache and mysql servers start and begin answering requests.

It's very intuitive and lets you configure the apache and the mysql port through its UI.

Available for [[Windows]] as well despite the name.
