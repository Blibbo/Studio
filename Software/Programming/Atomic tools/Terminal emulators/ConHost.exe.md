**ConHost.exe** is the default terminal emulator in [[Windows 10]] and probably lots of previous [[Windows]] versions.

## Shortcuts

These are handy keyboard shortcuts for the terminal.

- `Up Arrow` ^up-arrow
	- Pastes the previous command entered.
	  You can use it more than once to go further back in command history
- `Down Arrow`
	- Next command
	- Doesn't do anything unless you used [[#^up-arrow]] before
- `Ctrl + Down Arrow`
	- Go down one line in the screen. As in, scrolling.
