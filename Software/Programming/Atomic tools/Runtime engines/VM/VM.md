VMs are a specific type of [[runtime environment|runtime environment]].
The distinction is that virtual machines specifically try to emulate hardware that's not there.
A generic runtime environment doesn't necessarily do that, it just sorta executes stuff.

 Runtime environments generally perform light-hearted gaslighting, while virtual machines work with really well thought out make-believe.
