### About Notepad++

- released under the [[GPL]]

---

### Shortcuts

- `Ctrl + D`
	- duplicate line
	- it adds a line below without overwriting anything (rest of doc shifts downwards)
	- doesn't copy to clipboard
- `Ctrl + T`
	- swap current line with line above
	- leaves cursor on the line number you were in, so you can swap it back right away
	- if you're on the first line, it does nothing
- `Ctrl + Tab`
	- switch to most recently opened editor

---

### Trivia

- I'm very fond of this editor
- this and the [[gcc]] make for a very comforting combo
