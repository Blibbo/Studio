## Trivia

Internet Explorer was an official Microsoft moment

### History

It was bad.

More accurately, this browser **was** way ahead of the curve at its peak.

However, it didn't follow the [[W3C]] guidelines like other browsers of its time, such as [[Netscape]].
This was a deliberate business choice.
The point was to develop cutting-edge browser technology that didn't conform to the standards, so that:
- developers who wanted to employ it needed to program sites specifically for this browser
- sites made for this browser wouldn't work as good anywhere else
- users of these sites were forced into using Internet Explorer.

In practice, developers had to use tons of workarounds to make stuff work here _too_, on top of making it work everywhere else. Because that's what you **do**.

On top of this, starting in 1997, IE began to come preinstalled with [[Windows]].
Windows is the default OS PC vendors give you.
**_meaning:_** this shit is what came _**with**_ the pc.

This contributed to a big antitrust lawsuit against microsoft.

IE was a disservice to everyone:
- users would see sites break because it's hard to make them IE compatible
- some sites would be _only_ IE compatible instead
- good sites required a waste of programmers' time into studying both the standard and the IE quirks

Internet Explorer was discontinued in January 2020
