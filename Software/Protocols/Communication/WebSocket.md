### About WebSocket

- pairs up with [[HTTP]]
- full duplex communication
- single, long-lived connection
- allows browsers to break free from the request-response model
- the reason why browsers don't just use regular sockets is because of all the bullshit that was built on top of sockets for security ([[Firewalls]]). This protocol bypasses this by working on the same ports as HTTP.
