### About UEFI

- [[BIOS]] but newer and with GUIs and stuff
- 32 and 64-bit processor modes
- **Secure Boot**
- extensible (allows for development of plugins, drivers etc)
- allows firmware-level access to network resources (for firmware updates, for example)
	- which means it supports [[TCP]]/[[IP]] protocols
- follows BIOS standards and just expands on them

### Partitioning scheme

- _"Supports both MBR and GPT (GUID Partition Table), providing advantages like support for larger disk sizes and more partitions."_
- i have no idea what any of this means

- they made it to be modern and overcome the limitations of traditional BIOS
- **AMI** (**American Megatrends International**) is a popular BIOS and UEFI firmware provider
