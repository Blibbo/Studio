### About GPL

- it's a license developed by [[FSF]] as part of the [[GNU|GNU Project]]
- the license basically says "this software is mega free and open-source and you can't turn it into a proprietary bullshit"
- it's based on a _copyleft_ mechanism: if you copy the software that has this license, you must use this same license that tells people to use this license and so on
- it's the reason why all [[Linux]] distros are free. Linux has this license
- the most used ones are **GPL-2.0** and **GPL-3.0**
