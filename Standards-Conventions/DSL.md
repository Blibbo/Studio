### External DSL (eDSL)

- a whole syntax gets created for this task
- **Examples:** [[SQL]], [[CSS]]

### Internal DSL (iDSL) or Embedded DSL

- embedded in a general purpose programming language (frameworks usually)
- **Examples:** [[Ruby on Rails]] for #web-development, [[TensorFlow]] for #machine-learning in [[Python]]
