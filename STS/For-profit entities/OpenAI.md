**OpenAI** is a company that focuses on research in the field of [[AI]] and [[COMPUTER SCIENCE/THEORETICAL/ALGORITHMS/AI/ML|Machine Learning]].
Its goal is getting as close as possible to [[AGI]].

It was initially founded as a non-profit organization in December 2015 by [[Elon Musk]], Sam Altman, Greg Brockman, Ilya Sutskever, Wojciech Zaremba, and John Schulman, and others.

In 2019, OpenAI transitioned into a for-profit company, OpenAI LP, with the goal of securing additional funding to support its ambitious research agenda. [[Microsoft]] was one of the investors in OpenAI's Series C funding round in 2019, which raised $1 billion. Other investors in the round included entities like Altos Ventures, Reid Hoffman's charitable foundation, Khosla Ventures, and others.

Elon Musk was cut off before it started to make money, so he sued (after they made money).
