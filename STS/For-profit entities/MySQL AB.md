Used to be a swedish company. They made [[MySQL]].
They sold the company to [[Sun Microsystems]] in 2008.

## MySQL

They decided to offer MySQL on the [[GPL]], but they also sold it on commercial licenses.
The point of the commercial license is to incorporate MySQL in a closed-source project without being forced to adhere to the GPL's terms (exposing the source code).

MySQL AB's approach demonstrated that open-source software development can be compatible with for-profit business models.
