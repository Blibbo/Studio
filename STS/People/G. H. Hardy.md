## Applied mathematics

>Hardy preferred his work to be considered pure mathematics, perhaps because of his detestation of war and the military uses to which mathematics had been applied. He made several statements similar to that in his Apology:
>![[A Mathematician's Apology#Quotes]]

Despite what he says, he has been a beast in applied mathematics:

>aside from formulating the Hardy–Weinberg principle in population genetics, ==his famous work== on integer partitions with his collaborator Ramanujan, known as the Hardy–Ramanujan asymptotic formula, ==has been widely applied in physics to find quantum partition functions of atomic nuclei== (first used by Niels Bohr) ==and to derive thermodynamic functions of non-interacting Bose–Einstein systems==. Though Hardy wanted his maths to be "pure" and devoid of any application, much of his work has found applications in other branches of science

## [[Ramanujan]]

Hardy was a mentor to Ramanujan from 1914 onwards

>In an interview by Paul Erdős, when Hardy was asked what his greatest contribution to mathematics was, Hardy unhesitatingly replied that it was the discovery of Ramanujan
