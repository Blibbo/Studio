His work is influential and foundational to diverse fields, such as analytic philosophy, linguistics and maths.

## He's a big deal

He made [[axiom|axiomatic]] [[FOL|predicate logic]] from the ground up.
He invented a [[language (maths)]] that looks like [[Arithmetic]], but applies to [[logic]].

> The analysis of logical concepts and the machinery of formalization that is essential to [[Principia Mathematica]], to [[Bertrand Russel|Russel]]'s [[theory of descriptions]], to Kurt [[GÃ¶del's incompleteness theorems]], and to Alfred Tarski's theory of truth, is ultimately due to Frege.

## Trivia

His work is so important but it seems to me like he enjoyed naming his concepts arbitrarily.
The thing i find funny is that the names he gives things ==just don't stick==. He wanted to make fetch happen so bad.
Not even just the names: the symbols too. Look at [[Begriffsschrift]].

I don't know whether he invented the *all* the symbols for predicate logic yet. If he did, then I gotta say most of them stuck.
