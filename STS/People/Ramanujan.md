**Srinivasa Ramanujan** was a [[Mathematics|mathematician]] of the ${ \text{XX} }$ century who died at 32.
They made a movie on him and stuff.

His whole deal is that mathematicians didn't take him seriously until he met [[G. H. Hardy]], and they had say gex

![[G. H. Hardy#Ramanujan]]

## Extraordinary genius

His wikipedia page dick rides him so hard. So much so that it's funny; I'm serious, check this shit out:

>Ramanujan independently compiled nearly 3,900 results

>completely novel solutions to mathematical problems then considered unsolvable

>he had almost no formal training

>original and highly unconventional results, such as the Ramanujan prime, the Ramanujan theta function, partition formulae and mock theta functions, have opened entire new areas of work and inspired further research

> The Ramanujan Journal, a scientific journal, was established to publish work in all areas of mathematics influenced by Ramanujan, and his notebooks—containing summaries of his published and unpublished results—have been analysed and studied for decades since his death as a source of new mathematical ideas.

>As late as 2012, researchers continued to discover that mere comments in his writings about "simple properties" and "similar outputs" for certain findings were themselves profound and subtle number theory results that remained unsuspected until nearly a century after his death
