**Pythagoras of Samos** was an ancient (~2500 years ago) Greek philosopher who formed a group of mathematicians who worked religiously on numbers and lived like monks. Although Pythagoras introduced the theorem, there is evidence that proves that it existed in other civilizations too, 1000 years before Pythagoras was born. The oldest known evidence is seen between the 20th to the 16th century B.C in the Old Babylonian Period
