## Maths stuff

Platonists call mathematical concepts _objects_ of [[mathematics]].
Plato insisted these objects belonged to a world of maths that's independent from the real one and independent from our minds.
It's the same world as his other "platonic [[#ideas]]"
Truths about these objects can be discovered.
