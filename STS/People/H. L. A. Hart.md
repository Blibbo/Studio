**Herbert Lionel Adolphus Hart** was a legal philosopher.

On the wikipedia article for semiosis, he's mentioned because the intentionality of [[sign|signs]] is called into question.
He's a legal philosopher, so that's sorta his thing. Voluntary vs involuntary manslaughter and stuff.

He also worked with [[Alan Turing]].
