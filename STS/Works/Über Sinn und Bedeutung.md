**On Sense and Reference** is a 1892 book by [[Gottlob Frege]] that analyzes language.
In this book, Frege formulates his own theory of meaning.

## Reference

According to Frege, the **reference** or **referent** (_Bedeutung_, literally _"meaning"_) is an extralinguistic object that any expression is referencing.
Names in a sentence and the sentence itself represent a specific referent.

==N.B.== some parts of the sentence, instead of having a referent, have something that Frege calls a [[Funktion und Begriff#concept|"concept"]]. 

## Sense

According to Frege, _Sinn_ (sense) is the **mode of presentation** of a [[#Reference]]. This mode of presentation is known and shared by people, and it's how we communicate.
Each significant expression in a sentence (and also the sentence itself) has its own unique **sense**.

## The actual argument

The big argument this book makes is that ***==the referent of a full sentence is a truth value==***.

What that suggests is that when we say _anything_, we're actually (implicitly and unknowingly) referring to "true" or "false".
So when I say _"You're ugly!"_ I actually mean ([[#Reference|refer to]]) _"true!"_, but in a very different [[#sense]].
It sounds batshit insane to me.

By this definition, identity statements such as _"Bruce Wayne is Batman"_ become different modes of presentation (senses) of the truth.

Let's put it to the test. Let's make an identity statement relating that sense of the truth I mentioned above to its referent, and let's see if it also checks out and is truthy itself:

_"Bruce Wayne is Batman" is true._
And again
_«"Bruce Wayne is Batman" is true» is true._

Frege is convincing.

The [[#Sense]] of a complete sentence is the thought we're expressing.
Its [[#Reference]], instead, is the truth value.
