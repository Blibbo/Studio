**Function and Concept** is [[Gottlob Frege]]'s clarification of what the terms "object" and "concept" mean in [[Über Sinn und Bedeutung|On Sense and Reference]].

Frege claims that concepts and functions are analogous.
A concept takes an object as an argument and returns a truth value, forming the reference of the sentence.

## Object

An **object** is a part of the sentence that "makes sense by itself" because it has a [[Über Sinn und Bedeutung#reference|reference]] that's an actual thing.
Not like a physical thing, but _some_ thing.
Examples: "dog", "Michael Jackson", "my house", "anger"

## Concept

Some parts of the sentence, according to Frege, don't make sense by themselves.
Example: "is hot".

The [[Über Sinn und Bedeutung#reference|reference]] of such a part of the sentence is a **concept**. By itself, this reference isn't an actual thing.
He describes concepts as being analogous to [[function (computer science)|functions]]: concepts want [[#object|objects]] as arguments to make full sentences. Full sentences [[Über Sinn und Bedeutung#The full/complete sentence|do]] have actual references.
