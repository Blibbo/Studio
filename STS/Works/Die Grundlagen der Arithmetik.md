## Three fundamental principles

At the beginning of the book Frege states this:

>In the enquiry that follows, I have kept to three fundamental principles:
>
>>always to separate sharply the psychological from the logical, the subjective from the objective;
>
>>never to ask for the meaning of a word in isolation, but only in the context of a proposition
>
>>never to lose sight of the distinction between concept and object.

### Context principle

>never ... ask for the meaning of a word in isolation, but only in the context of a proposition

Frege's applies this view on numbers. He doesn't think numbers are real on their own.

>Frege uses the example of a deck of cards to show numbers do not inhere in objects. Asking "how many" is nonsense without the further clarification of cards or suits or what, showing numbers belong to concepts, not to objects.
