**Principia Mathematica** is a series of three books written with the goal of defining once and for all what the [[foundations of mathematics]] are.
It tried to describe what [[axiom|axioms]] and inference rules are necessary to prove all current & future maths.

It was written by [[Alfred North Whitehead]] and [[Bertrand Russel|Bertrand Russel]].

[[GÃ¶del's incompleteness theorems]] later proved that you can't just prove all of maths with a single set of axioms, which makes PM's ambitious attempt (and any other attempt) futile.

This book is cool because it uses tons of symbolic logic and formalism, and it should have modern notation in comparison to Begriffsschrift.

## [[Begriffsschrift]]++

Begriffsschrift was an inspiration for this book series.
Since PM is about finding axioms and making the logic sound, Russel tried fixing a bunch of Begriffsschrift's logic, most famously the paradox he himself found; [[Russel's Paradox]]
