Bell Telephone Laboratories was a research and development organization founded in 1925 as a subsidiary of [[AT&T]].

It played a profoundly important role in the development of [[Digital Computer|digital computers]] in general.

Working here, [[Dennis Ritchie]] and [[Ken Thompson]] made [[B]], then [[C]], then [[Unix]].

This company did something important about [[transistor|transistors]] and [[laser|lasers]]. I'm not sure what though.
