A **sign** is _anything_ capable of conveying meaning, and it's produced by a living thing.

Signs can communicate through any of the five senses.

Our brain seeks patterns and might imagine something to be a sign even if it's not.

A sign can be voluntary or involuntary.

Examples:
- a symptom can be a sign of a medical condition
