An **analytic proposition** is a [[proposition]] whose predicate concept is contained in its subject concept

An analytic proposition's [[proposition#truth value|truth value]] depends on its meaning alone.

Analytic propositions are necessarily also [[a priori proposition|a priori propositions]].
"Analytic a priori" propositions get commonly just called _analytic propositions_, but it has these two different connotations.

As far as I understand, these are all [[tautology|tautologies]].

Examples:
- "All bachelors are unmarried."
- "All triangles have three sides."
