A **synthetic proposition** is a [[proposition]] whose predicate concept is _not_ contained in its subject concept but related.

A synthetic proposition's [[proposition#truth value|truth value]] depends on how the thought expressed by the proposition relates to the real world.

Their [[proposition#Truth value|truth value]] is in a gray area of uncertainty.

Examples
- "All bachelors are alone."
- "All creatures with hearts have kidneys."

==N.B.:== it's **not** about the subjectivity of the truth value. They're synthetic because:

 The _definition_ of "bachelor" doesn't contain the concept of "alone".
 The _definition_ of "creatures with hearts" doesn't contain "kidney".
