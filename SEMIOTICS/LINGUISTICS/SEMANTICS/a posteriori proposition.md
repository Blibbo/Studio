An **a posteriori proposition** is a [[proposition]] whose justification does rely upon experience. The proposition is validated by, and grounded in, experience. Therefore, it is logically contingent.

A posteriori propositions are all [[synthetic proposition|synthetic]]. Propositions that are _synthetic a posteriori_ get called **empirical**.

Examples
- "All bachelors are unhappy."
- "Tables exist."
