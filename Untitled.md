- A
	- b
		- can do this cool "range based" `{cpp}for` loop
			- don't bother with indexes, just use the value. No off-by-one errors
		- `{cpp}for(const int v : {-129, -128, -1, 0, 42, 127, 128, 255, 256}){}`
- A
	- bad
		- C
			- debugging
				- `{cpp}T x, y, z;`
				- `{cpp}(&x)[1] == y`. That's true.
	- **METHODS**
		- **CONST METHOD**
			- `{cpp}int myMethod() const {}`
			- the state of the object won't change through the function
		- **METHOD CHAINING**
			- `{cpp}return` type of your method must be a reference type to its own class
			- `{cpp}return` value of your method must be the own object (content of "`{cpp}this`" pointer)
			```cpp
			MyClass& chainableMethod(){
				return *this;
			}
			```
			- then `{cpp}obj.chainableMethod().chainableMethod().chainableMethod()`
		- **CONSTRUCTOR**
			- **MEMBER INITIALIZER LISTS**
				- **USAGE:**
					- constructor for a class called Example with x and y as int properties
					- `{cpp}Example(int a, int b) : x(a), y(b) {}`
				- **NOTES:**
					- the member initializer syntax initializes the members (wow)
					- initializing follows order of declaration INSIDE THE CLASS
					- order in which you write them INSIDE THE INITIALIZER is arbitrary and it does not matter
					- only way to initialize constant members
					- good practice regardless (for non constant members too)
	- **IN-CLASS MEMBER INITIALIZATION**
		- **USAGE:**
			- declare and initialize a property directly in the class
			- `{cpp}int myProperty = 3;`
				- from inside a class. Not in a method
		- **NOTES:**
			- before the C++11 standard, you could only use constants (instead of the integer literal "3" used here)
			- mind blowing line of code, I know
			- you're not entitled to this syntax, be grateful
	- **FRIEND FUNCTIONS**
		- **DECLARATION:**
			- inside the class add this signature
			- `{cpp}friend void myFriend(MyClass&);`
		- **DEFINITION:**
			- outside the class
			- `{cpp}void myFriend(MyClass& obj){}`
		- **NOTES:**
			- they're not members of the class
			- they can access private and protected stuff all the same
	- **STATIC PROPERTIES**
		- inside a class
		- `{cpp}static int a = 3;`
		- `{cpp}static void StaticMethod(){}`
		- **NOTES:**
			- it's a member.
			- every object shares it
			- this method can't access
	- **NESTED TYPES**
		- **DECLARATION**
		- **USAGE**
			- outside the class
			- `{cpp}MyClass:: myString;`
			- inside the class ==a==
			- `{cpp}str myProperty;`
		- **NOTES:**
			- you'll always need to use the CRO () if you use this type outside of the class
			- you can define a type inside a class through:
				- `{cpp}typedef`
				- `{cpp}struct`
				- `{cpp}class` (straight up another `{cpp}class`)
