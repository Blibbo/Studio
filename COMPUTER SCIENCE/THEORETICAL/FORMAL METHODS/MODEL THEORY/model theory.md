**Model theory** has somethig to do with [[formal language|formal languages]]. Ion know though

ChatGPT says it "studies the structures that satisfy given logical formulas".
I guess that's sorta like how an [[ordered pair]] has a defining behavior (i.e. ${ (a_{1},b_{1}) = (a_{2},b_{2}) \Longleftrightarrow a_{1}=a_{2}, b_{1}=b_{2} }$) but several different definitions that can satisfy it and give it its properties (e.g. ${ \{ \{ a \}, \{ a, b \} \} := (a,b) }$). So model theory would look for other alternative definitions, if that's correct.

Terms to investigate: [[model existence]], [[categoricity]], [[completeness]]
