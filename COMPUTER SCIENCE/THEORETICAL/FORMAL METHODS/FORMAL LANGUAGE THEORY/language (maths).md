A **language**, according to [[formal language theory]] (I think, otherwise just according to maths), is a [[subset]] of all possible combinations of [[letter|letters]] in an [[alphabet]].

I have found a single source ([[#^planet-math]]) that seemingly separates this definition from that of [[formal language|formal languages]].
That is, if according to this source, a language with a [[formal grammar]] is a formal language.

Languages "in general" are just a thing that is not usually defined through maths and formalisms. It's formal languages that are more common and appropriate here.
