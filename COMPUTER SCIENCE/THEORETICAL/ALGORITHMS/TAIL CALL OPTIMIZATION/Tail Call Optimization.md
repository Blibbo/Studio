This algorithm works like an infinite call stack for function calls.
After implementing this, you won't have to worry about memory limits on the function call stack.
Call a function recursively 2 million times, it'll work just fine.

Typical in [[functional programming]] languages, but not exclusive to them. It can be implemented anywhere.
