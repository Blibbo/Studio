**Data compression** is the process of squeezing [[data]] into smaller data (less symbols) that still represents the original [[information]].

This stuff is genuinely super interesting, read wikipedia:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_compression

## Lossless

**Lossless data compression** is a kind of compression where you retain the same identical information as the original data.
If it's possible to compress without any loss, then it means the original data has **statistical redundancies**.

## Lossy

**Lossy data compression** loses some information but tries to retain the important part.
