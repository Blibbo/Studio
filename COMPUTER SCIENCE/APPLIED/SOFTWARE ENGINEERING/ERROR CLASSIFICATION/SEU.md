A **single-event upset** is a type of [[soft error]] where a bit changes but you can rewrite it without any problem.
It's hard to detect where it happens and it's also hard to detect _if_ it happens and _why_ it happens.

There's no reason for this to happen. This is related to [[radioactivity]] and [[cosmic ray bit flipping]] and it's insane that it happens.

## Formally

A single-event upset, also known as a single-event error, is a change of state caused by one single ionizing particle striking a sensitive node in a live micro-electronic device, such as in a microprocessor, semiconductor memory, or power transistors.
