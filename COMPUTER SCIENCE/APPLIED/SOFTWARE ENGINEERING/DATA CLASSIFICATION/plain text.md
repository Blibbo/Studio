[[data]] written in any major [[text encoding|text encoding format]].

You could just say "text". We say "plain text" because we emphasize that the data is composed of nothing else but encoded characters.

## Elucidation

Sometimes people say "plain text" to contrast with [[Rich Text]], as to exclude any text describing [[markup]] or [[metadata]].

Truth is, generally, rich text _is_ plain text too though.
The argument in favor of this is that _the particular content is irrelevant to whether a file is plain text_. The whole point is the encoding.

## Trivia

This term used to refer to a specific encoding, [[ASCII]]. Now it can mean any of the major formats.

There's something called [[endianness]] and idfk what it is, look it up:
