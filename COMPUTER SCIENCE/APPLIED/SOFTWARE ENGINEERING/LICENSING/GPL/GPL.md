The **GPL** is an [[open-source license]] developed by [[FSF]] as part of the [[GNU|GNU Project]].

The license basically says "this software is mega free and open and you can't turn it into proprietary bullshit"

It's based on a _copyleft_ mechanism: if you copy the software that has this license, you must use this same license that tells people to use this license and so on.

It's the reason why all [[Linux]] distros are free. Linux has this license, although technically, just the kernel and userland are protected.

The most used ones are **GPL-2.0** and **GPL-3.0**
