### About architectures

- they're an abstraction for hardware.
- you follow this abstraction to build real hardware that adheres to the standard
- the term is very broad. Every hardware component must be made in a way that makes sense for other people. Typically, the distinction is:
	- if you'd be capable of building that component (a logic gate) then it's inappropriate to call it an architecture. Way too simple
	- if it's alien tech (a [[Microprocessor]] or an [[SSD]]) then I'll put the note in this "architectures" folder.
