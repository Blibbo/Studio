An architecture is a specification for how a kind of hardware component must work. It's a standard.

The reason we need this specification is because while there are many ways to do things, we also want things made by different people to work together.

For example, [[microprocessor]] architectures serve the purpose of making [[software]] work in every new machine you make.

No corporation would be interested in making a new cpu that can't run any existing [[firmware]]. It's just dumb
