### About ARMv8-A

- [[ARMv8]] extension
- tailored for [[Application processor]]s (e.g. Cortex-A series)
- adds 64-bit support. The 64-bit instruction set is incompatible with the old 32-bit one, so it is not an extension
- allows for a switch between two instruction sets: [[ARM32|AArch32]] and [[ARM64|AArch64]]

### What it brings to the table
