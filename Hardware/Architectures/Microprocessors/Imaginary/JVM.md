### About the JVM

- provides abstraction for real hardware
- it has a made up instruction set. [[#Bytecode instruction set]]
- bytecode files have a `.class` extension
- apparently `.jar` too idk

---

### Bytecode instruction set

- [It's on wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Java_bytecode_instructions)

---

### Java Virtual Machine Specification

- it talks about stuff like [[JIT]] compilers, JNIs, NMIs and other made up acronyms

---

### Trivia

- the [[#Java Virtual Machine Specification]] is owned by Oracle and all JVMs must adhere
- the whole point was to have [[Java]] applications be cross-platform
