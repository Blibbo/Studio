### About binary instruction formats

- a format for binary instructions.
- At its fundamental level (machine code), it coincides with the phrase [[ISA|"Instruction Set"]]
- the reason why we have the phrase _"binary instruction format"_ is because sometimes these binary instructions aren't part of an existing instruction set built into a real [[Microprocessor]]
- so when you see "binary instruction format", we're typically talking about **made up hardware** that will execute the format. Abstraction for real hardware.

### Abstraction for real hardware

- the idea is to have actual software somehow make sense of the made up software. This software is a [[Runtime Environments|Runtime Environment]] or a [[Virtual Machine]]
