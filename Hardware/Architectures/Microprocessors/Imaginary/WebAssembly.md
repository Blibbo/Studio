**WebAssembly** is a binary instruction format.

Wasm code is stored in binary [[file|files]] with `.wasm` extension.

Up-to-date [[JavaScript]] engines have a [[VM]] that knows how to deal with this format (by executing it)

Languages like [[C]], [[C++]] and [[Rust]] can choose to compile to this instead of to regular [[Assembly]].

## Trivia

WebAssembly is sort of a misnomer. [[Assembly]] languages are usually mnemonic (human-readable). This, is not.

[[W3C]] has to do something with wasm but I'm not sure they standardize it.
