- has its own [[Virtual Machines|Virtual Machine]] that executes `.wasm`s and stuff
- [[JavaScript]] engines usually know how to deal with this format
- high level languages like [[C]], [[C++]] and [[Rust]] can choose to compile to this instead of to regular [[Assembly]]
- [All Specs](https://webassembly.org/specs/)
