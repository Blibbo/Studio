### About IL

- [[Binary Instruction Formats|Binary Instruction Format]]
- executed by the [[CLR]]
- stack-based architecture (idk what that means)
- compiled assemblies are stored in `.exe`s or `.dll`s. The binary format in which it's written is standardized and it includes the metadata necessary for the [[CLR]] to load and execute the code
- [[JIT]] compiling
- **IL Disassemblers** can be used to view the IL representation of compiled assemblies
