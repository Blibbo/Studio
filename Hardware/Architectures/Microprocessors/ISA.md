An **instruction set** is a list of binary instruction addresses built into the [[CPU]].

It's the foundation of software. This is what allows you to write code and interact with the hardware

The instruction codes are variable in length.

If you look in the documentation for the instruction set of your CPU, binary codes will be associated with [[mnemonic]] codes.
The list of mnemonic instructions forms what is called an [[assembly|assembly language]].

### Extendibility

- if they "make extensions" to an instruction set, it means the manufacturers produce new processors that support them
- the goal of an extension, other than adding functionality, is backwards compatibility with processors *without* the extension
- **Examples of extensions:**
