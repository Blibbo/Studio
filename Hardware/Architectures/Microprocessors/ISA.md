### About Instruction Sets

- they're a list of binary instruction addresses that translate to mnemonic codes
- instruction addresses are variable in length
- they're built into the [[CPU]]
- it's the foundation of software. This is what allows you to write code and interact with the hardware
- if you don't like the instruction set, you **buy a new processor** or use a [[runtime environment|runtime environment]]. There's no way to modify an already built processor

---

### Extendibility

- if they "make extensions" to an instruction set, it means the manufacturers produce new processors that support them
- the goal of an extension, other than adding functionality, is backwards compatibility with processors *without* the extension
- **Examples of extensions:**
