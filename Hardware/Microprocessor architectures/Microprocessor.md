### ISA

- stands for **Instruction Set Architecture**
- it's a list of binary instruction addresses that are basically printed in the microprocessor
- the codes are variable in length
- it's literally all the microprocessor understands in terms of computing
- the most popular one is the x86, after the ISA of the [[Intel 8086]]
	- exists currently in two versions: the [[x86-32|32 bit one]] and the [[x86-64|64 bit one]]
	- those versions are backwards compatible with the 16 bit one of the original 8086
	- after all those fucking years, programs that ran on _that_ still also run on our alien tech cpus
