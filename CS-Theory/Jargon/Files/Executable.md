Executables are [[file|files]] that your [[OS]] is capable of executing.

They typically contain a series of instructions from the [[ISA|Instruction Set]] of your [[CPU]], because that's... what software is, fundamentally.

However, there can be executables that have other formats, and are executables because they run on specific [[Runtime Environment|runtime engines]] or [[interpreter|interpreters]].

## Elucidation

There isn't a strict definition for what an executable is.
It's more or less what I said, but think about this: what if you installed a runtime engine that allows you to execute [[Source Code]] directly without leaving a trace?
Did your [[Source File|source files]] become executables all of a sudden, now that your [[OS]] is able to call that program automatically to execute them?
