A program is a set of instructions that directs a [[computer]] to perform a specific task or series of tasks. 
It is a single piece of [[software]].

It's not necessarily a single [[executable]].

## Elucidation

You can't look at any specific entity in your computer and say for certain
_"This is it. This thing is a program."_, _"This file is the program"_
or
_"this whole folder is the program"_

It could be distributed everywhere in your computer all at once. You just **can't know**.
The single entity, the program, **is** the series of instructions. That's the definition.
No other one would be accurate in 100% of cases.

It has an entry point, sure. Its [[algorithm]] begins somewhere. That somewhere is probably an [[executable]].
