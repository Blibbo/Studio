Merge sort is a [[Sorting algorithm#Divide and conquer|divide and conquer]]-type [[Sorting algorithm#Stable sorting algorithm|stable sorting algorithm]] based on these three steps:
1. **Divide**: The original list is divided into two halves with a pivot element in the middle, kind of like in the [[quick sort]].
2. **Conquer**: Each half is recursively sorted.
3. **Combine**: The sorted halves are merged to produce a single sorted list.
