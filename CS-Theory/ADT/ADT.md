An abstract data type is a mathematical model for a data type defined by its behavior.
What these models strive to do is understand what the [[#domain]] of this type is, what the [[#operations]] you can perform with the domain are.

Abstract data types  coincide with [[algebraic structure|algebraic structures]] in maths.

There are two core elements to ADTs:
- the **domain** is the set of possible values this data type can assume
- **operations**: all the ways you can interact with the values in the domain.

Linear data structures see elements ordered in one dimension.
