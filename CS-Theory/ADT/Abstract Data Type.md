An abstract data type is a mathematical model for a data type defined by its behavior.
What these models strive to do is understand what the [[#domain]] of this type is, what the [[#operations]] you can perform with the domain are.

Abstract data types  coincide with [[algebraic structure|algebraic structures]] in maths.

## Domain

Possible values this data type can assume

## Operations

All the ways you can interact with the values in the domain.
