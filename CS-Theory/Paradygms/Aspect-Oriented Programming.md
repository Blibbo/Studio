Aspect-Oriented Programming complements [[Object-Oriented Programming|OOP]] by increasing the modularity.
As far as I understand, this means you can group classes together into things called _concerns_ or **aspects**.
You encapsulate separate areas of functionality that might encompass more than one class.

It "allows the modularization of cross-cutting concerns such as logging and security", whatever the **_FUCK_** that means.
