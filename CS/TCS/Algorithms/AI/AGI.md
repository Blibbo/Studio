**Artificial General Intelligence** is a hypothetical AI that is basically Jarvis from Iron Man.

>AGI refers to a hypothetical form of artificial intelligence that exhibits human-like cognitive abilities across a wide range of tasks. Unlike narrow or specialized AI systems, which are designed to perform specific tasks, AGI would possess general intelligence comparable to that of a human being, enabling it to learn and adapt to new situations, reason abstractly, understand natural language, and perform a variety of tasks with flexibility and autonomy.
