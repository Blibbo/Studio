A type of [[Algorithm]] that sorts lists

## Stable sorting algorithm

If a sorting algorithm is **stable**, it means it **preserves the relative order of equal elements**

## Divide and conquer

A divide and conquer sorting algorithm is one that divides the problem of sorting into sub-problems.
It does so by dividing your list into smaller lists to sort.
