A **process** is a [[program]] that has been loaded into memory by the [[OS|operating system]] and is currently using your resources.

You could open this program multiple times at the same time, which is why we say a process is a single **instance** of the program.

Each process has an identifier called [[PID]] and is visible through some version of a [[task manager]].
