A **standard stream** is a [[stream]] used by a [[program]] to read from or write to.
There are only three streams programs need:
- [[standard input]] to read the input
- [[standard output]] to write the output
- [[standard error]] to write the errors

## Trivia

>what are the main stream channels for programs
- This is a thing I actually asked [[ChatGPT]], genuinely wanting to know about [[standard input|stdin]], [[standard output|stdout]] and [[standard error|stderr]].
  I have NO CLUE why I used the word "channel" at all, I swear I wasn't trying to create the misunderstanding on purpose. It's so funny to me
