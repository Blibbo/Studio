A **dynamic programming language** is a language that offers features such as:
- late binding (where the association between identifiers and their definitions is resolved during execution)
- dynamic typing (where variable types are determined at runtime rather than compile-time)
- the ability to modify code structures (such as adding or removing methods or classes during execution).

These kinds of language are flexible and expressive.
It's common for [[scripting language|scripting languages]] to be dynamic.
