>OK. If they're so different then name ONE branch of formal logic that isn't used in mathematical logic.
- me @ chatgpt before finding this out

**Modal logic** is some philosophical shit and it's the only branch of [[formal logic]] I know of that is not used in maths.

It uses operators from [[propositional logic]] and [[FOL|predicate logic]], adding two more operators: [[possibility]] and [[necessity]].

The field is divided into [[epistemic modal logic]] and [[deontic logic|deontic modal logic]].
