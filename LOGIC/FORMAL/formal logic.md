**Formal logic** is a type of [[logic]] that consists in structuring your arguments according to a [[formal system]] where the [[wff]] is a [[statement]]. Such a system is called a [[logical system]].

With formal logic, you can get to conclusions and [[proof|proofs]] based on the structure of the argument alone, before even grasping whether it makes sense.
