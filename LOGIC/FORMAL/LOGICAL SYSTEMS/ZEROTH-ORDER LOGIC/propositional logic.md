## [[wff]]

A [[proposition]] is **well formed** if it is constructed with the following set of rules:

1. Any [[atomic formula|atomic proposition]] is a well formed formula.
2. If A is a well formed formula, then ¬A is also a well formed formula.
3. If A and B are well formed formulae, then (A∧B)(A∧B) is also a well formed formula.
4. If A and B are well formed formulae, then (A∨B)(A∨B) is also a well formed formula.
5. If A and B are well formed formulae, then (A→B)(A→B) is also a well formed formula.
6. If A and B are well formed formulae, then (A↔B)(A↔B) is also a well formed formula.
7. Unless constructed using only 1-6 above, then a proposition isn't a well formed formula.
