A **proposition** is a statement that is **true** or **false**.

- [[analytic proposition#^wikipedia]]

## Notation

A proposition can be either represented by a single [[#Propositional variables|variable]], or by an expression including [[logical connective|logical connectives]] and multiple variables, as long as it's [[propositional logic#WFF|well formed]].

### Propositional variables

**Propositional variables** or **proposition letters** are a [[notation]] to indicate [[variable|variables]] representing propositions.
The symbol is a bolded capital letter, for example:
$\mathbf{A}$
